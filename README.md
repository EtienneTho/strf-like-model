Its allows to generate beautiful images like this:

These scripts have been developed to compute STRFs like representations in: Thoret, E., Caramiaux, B., Depalle, P., McAdams, S. (2020) Learning metrics on spectrotemporal modulations reveals the perception of musical instrument timbre, Nature Human Behaviour (https://rdcu.be/cbuTM)
